  Scenario: NPSP New Opportunity creates Payment record
  Given I navigate to Opportunity
  When I create a new Opportunity with name "aaa" and close date today and amount "100" and stage "Closed Won"
    And I navigate from Opportunity to Payments
  Then I should see a payment record
    And the value of the payment should be "$100.00"
